# Rockbuster Stealth - a movie rental company
As part of CareerFoundry's Data Analysis course, I conducted an analysis of the PostgreSQL Sample Database of a ficticious movie rental company using SQL.

## Objectives
Rockbuster Stealth is a ficticious DVD rental company looking to tap into the market of online video rental. For that purpose they want to gain insights of their current portfolio performance and customer base to inform their company strategy.

Here are the main questions they would like answers for:
● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
● What was the average rental duration for all videos?
● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
